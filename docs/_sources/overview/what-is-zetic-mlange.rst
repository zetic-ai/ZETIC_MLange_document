.. ZETIC MLange Overview

What is ZETIC.MLange?
=========================

 ZETIC.MLange is an **end-to-end**, **one-stop**, **heterogeneous target support** On-device AI Software.

We unify all edge hardware's utilizations and make a new On-device AI ecosystem.
There are three big innovations in On-device AI with ZETIC.MLange

1. From model to target library, we provide **End-to-end on-device AI**.
2. MLange just needs a model and sample input. MLange is a solid **One-stop deployment** software.
3. MLange provides NPU utilizations for **Heterogeneous OS and target Hardware**. 
    - **80% of NPUs in the global smartphone market** are supported, and more is to be covered soon. 
    - **99.34% of mobile OS** in the global smartphone market are supported.

What ZETIC.MLange makes different?
----------------------------------

With ZETIC.MLange, you don't need to research, verify, and implement the On-device AI from the basics.
All you need to do is just run `mlange_gen` and deploy your App.
You can immediately get an On-device AI Application.

    - We provide a **one-stop**, **end-to-end** pipeline for On-device AI.
    - We provide **target HW specified model Compression** as default, you can also select options in Default mode, Accuracy first mode, and latency first mode.
    - We provide the most rapid deployment process for On-device AI, with Mobile NPU utilizations.
